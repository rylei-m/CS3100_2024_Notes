# Operating Systems 09/04/2024

## Multiprogramming
Running multiple programs at the same time \ 
Makes computers more efficient \
Gives us the ability to have concurrency

Max
- Operating System
- Process 1
- Process 2
- etc...
0

### A process is another program
They take space in an operating system \
Something that is executing

### Program
Stored on your computer, not a process because it is not executing

### Running
"Could be running on the CPU at any moment"

### Scheduling
Picks a process for the CPU to Execute

## Multi-Tasking
The thing that enables concurrency \
Processes "Time-share" after time expires something else runs \

## Dual/Multi-Mode Operation
Standard - User Processes
**Bold** - Admin-Level Process
- User Process Executing > Calls System Call > (trap mode bit = 0) **Execute System Call** (return mode bit = 1) > Return from System Call

## CPU-Timer
The thing that triggers a process to be kicked off the CPU and another to be Brought In \
An Interrupt is generated by the timer and sent to the CPU to stop and switch tasks

## Resource Management
- Process Management
- Creation of Processes
- Synchronization

## Memory Management
Our OS needs to decide what belongs in memory, where it goes, and how much memory it should have

## File System Management
Logical View of Data Storage
- Create and Delete File Folders
- Manipulate File Structure
- Backups

## Mass Storage Management
Long-Term Non-Volatile
- Mounting/Unmounting
- Manage Free Space
- Partitioning
- Protections
- Permissions/Protections

## Cache Management
To Store Data Temporarily so that it can be Quickly Accessed When Needed
- Overhead is a potential issue
- Mobile phones don't typically use Cache Management because the battery life is not good enough to make finding/deciding on cache worth it

Magnetic Disk > Main Memory > Cache > Hardware Register

## I/O SubSystem Management
The Memory Management of Devices

## Security
Any Mechanism for Controlling Computer Resources
- OS Controls access to processes, devices, etc 
- Security Triad 
  - CIA
    - Confidentiality - Keeping Data Private
    - Integrity - Accurate, Correct, Reliable Data
    - Availability - Data is Available to Authorized Users at Authorized Time
